# Session Handoff

## Current State

- State: `pending`
- Repository mode: isolated operational fork
- Deployment mode in active use: Coolify + `docker-compose.coolify.yml`
- Current active stand: `https://tunnel.hiddenrabbit.net.ru/panel`
- No intentional local paused patch should remain after this session.

## Stable / Confirmed

- panel is deployed in Coolify and can be updated from `main`;
- current redesign foundation is live:
  - light / dark / system themes;
  - new typography;
  - flatter UI language;
  - cleaner dashboard / settings / subscription surfaces;
- HAPP support layer has been expanded:
  - better settings labels;
  - support-status messaging model;
  - import behavior has been improved versus the earlier broken state;
- dashboard traffic card now uses an interactive smooth SVG line chart with hover point and tooltip;
- layout stabilization work was added for the page-shift bug after navigation;
- shell layout was moved to `grid + sticky sidebar` and deployed;
- topbar now contains the language switcher next to theme controls;
- visible login/setup/TOTP branding has started moving from `Celerity` toward `Hidden Rabbit`;
- user detail view now shows:
  - traffic progress;
  - active device sessions from Redis;
  - effective node coverage;
  - live node hints when attribution metadata is available.
- docs continuity layer is now the official local memory path for this fork.

## Done Recently

- added isolated continuity docs layer under `docs/`;
- formalized project isolation rules inside repo;
- formalized continuity law and session close law inside repo;
- redesigned major parts of the admin panel UI;
- deployed latest dashboard chart update to the live stand.
- committed and deployed the shell layout rewrite that had previously been paused locally;
- added overflow guards for page headers, tables, cards, charts, and dashboard columns;
- moved language controls from sidebar into the topbar utility cluster;
- made sidebar collapse control more explicit with label text;
- reduced stats chart point density adaptively and improved time tick formatting;
- recolored subscription and user-detail QR presentation toward project blue;
- expanded auth header aliases for node attribution and enriched user session hints from effective node lookup;
- replaced the most obvious visible `Celerity` branding on layout, login, setup, and TOTP screens.
- audited `upstream/main` and identified the most relevant candidate areas for later porting:
  - onboarding / bootstrap;
  - broadcast tooling;
  - Marzban migration;
  - client statistics experiments.

## Not Done Yet

- shell/layout bug is still unresolved:
  - user reports the design still shifts / drifts outside the browser width;
  - this happens on navigation and in some views;
  - the shell rewrite has now been deployed, but needs real verification on the live stand.
- dashboard / stats visuals still need cleanup:
  - traffic chart density was reduced and the dashboard period toggle exists now;
  - charts still need visual refinement and calmer rhythm on the live page;
  - segmented rings still need closer matching to the user reference.
- user-level stats are improved but not complete:
  - per-user traffic and device activity now exist in operator UI;
  - exact live node attribution is improved with header aliases and node-id fallback lookup but still depends on metadata being sent consistently;
  - user wants clear visibility of which node(s) a user is actually using, especially once cascades grow.
- repository separation from visible `Celerity` identity is not complete:
  - the most visible surfaces were renamed, but legacy references still exist in repo text, metadata, comments, and some auxiliary screens;
  - user wants this fork to continue moving away from the original branding.
- dashboard and shell redesign still need more polish:
  - sidebar collapse affordance was improved but needs live confirmation;
  - settings item should be rechecked for icon visibility in all states on the live stand;
  - background texture is more neutral now but may still need one more pass;
  - circular metrics should use a segmented / dashed ring style like the provided reference;
  - subscription QR code background/frame was recolored, but should be checked on real devices and browsers.
- upstream comparison baseline exists, but adoption triage is still not finished.

## Known Broken / Risky / Pending

- page-drift / width-shift bug is still the highest current UX blocker until the deployed shell rewrite is verified;
- some screenshots referenced by the user could not be loaded locally because the files were no longer present at the provided paths;
- dashboard graph interaction works, and density was reduced, but final visual approval is still pending;
- HAPP behavior should keep being tested on real clients after UI changes;
- user live-node visibility still depends on optional device metadata headers and is not guaranteed for every session, even though aliases/fallback enrichment improved it;
- old historical docs exist, but the new continuity set is now the primary path.

## Stop Point

The continuity layer is now in place.

The repo has a local source of truth and a clean session-entry order.

No automatic next wave is opened by this handoff.

## Next Step

Next practical step:

1. resolve the shell/page-drift bug first and only then deploy new UI changes;
2. verify the deployed shell rewrite on the live stand and identify any remaining drifting page/container;
3. after layout is stable, continue with:
   - dashboard traffic/stats cleanup and chart polish;
   - user session node attribution;
   - controlled removal of `Celerity` branding from visible surfaces;
   - upstream adoption triage.

## User-Requested Follow-Up Queue

The next session should keep this exact queue in mind:

1. fix the persistent layout drift / page-width bug;
2. verify the new shell rewrite and identify the last page(s) that still drift;
3. continue graph cleanup and improve chart readability;
4. move language controls next to the theme switcher on the right;
5. make sidebar collapse behavior more obvious;
6. ensure every nav item, including Settings, has a visible icon in all states;
7. neutralize the page background texture further;
8. switch circular meters to a segmented ring style matching the user reference;
9. recolor subscription QR framing / background to project blue;
10. continue stronger visual and textual separation from `Celerity`;
11. complete true node attribution for active user sessions;
12. decide which upstream changes to port first.

## 2026-04-16 Late Update

- Deployed `aad44b4 fix: localize dashboard shell and tighten layout bounds`.
- Tightened shell bounds again:
  - switched `overflow-x` guards from `clip` to `hidden` on core shell containers;
  - added extra `min-width: 0`, `width: 100%`, and `contain: inline-size` guards on topbar, content, main-content, stats grid, dashboard grid, and hero blocks;
  - narrowed dashboard sidebar grid column to `minmax(0, 320px)` instead of a raw fixed track.
- Replaced top-level hardcoded strings on `layout.ejs` and `dashboard.ejs` with locale-backed labels.
- Added missing locale keys for:
  - collapse / expand / toggle sidebar;
  - light / dark / system theme labels;
  - dashboard hero and traffic-card labels.

### Current Verification Need

The user still reports that the layout can drift on the live stand, so this fix must be verified manually in-browser after deployment.

### Immediate Next Check

1. Open the live stand and switch between `Dashboard / Statistics / Nodes / Users / Settings`.
2. Confirm whether the right edge still drifts off-screen.
3. Confirm dashboard/topbar copy is now consistently localized in both `ru` and `en`.
